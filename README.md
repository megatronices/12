ive tried so many times with many vibe coding platforms either i dont get what i need or it ends in just a mock data results
this is the first one that actually provides real time results for tokens on solana blockchain ie it scans for tokens on dexscreener using freely 
available api and will provide alerts in real time when ma cross over or macd cross over occurs as well as have included forwarding to jup.ag for
easy trading as well as telegram integration etc
this is for personnel use only 
if you like do donate to buy me a beer!
